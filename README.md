## FAQ
- Can other people see my emotes? - No, however in the future support for this mod will be added to [Astral TERA](https://github.com/codeagon/Astral-TERA).
- Command no werk???? - Please make sure your proxy version is up to date. Also use Caali's proxy because I can't be bothered adding code to support pinkies at the present time.
